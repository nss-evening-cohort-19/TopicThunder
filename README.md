## The Who, How, and Why

***

* **Primary Features**

The application allows a user to create a personal board to save pins that would have use in their life or edification of the soul. A user can create, edit, update and delete their individual board or pins only.

* **Target Audience**

This is for any user that wishes to explore and save pin with content to their board for later use. 

* **Purpose**

This project is for users who wish to add pins to their board for saving content and contributing pins/ content for others with interactive components. 

* **Getting Started** 

You can start testing the product by logging in with your respective Google account or using the guest login button if you only wish to view the project without exploring all functions. If authenticated, use the home page buttons to view all the pins created in a random fashion. If you only need a smaller set of pins to view, you may click the Today link on the NavBar to view only today's sorted pins. The best way to begin is to:

* Create a profile on the profile page 

* Click the plus icon to create a board to store your pins under 

* Create pins under the board to have a collection of pins based on your thought process or inspiration. 

* Use the side bar that pulls out in the profile page to access the sign out button to exit the app.
